# Analyze the Boot Process

The systemd-analyze command allows you to view information about your boot
process, such as how long it took and which services (and other processes)
added the most time to the boot process.

## To view information about the startup process in general, run this command:

    systemd-analyze

## To view how long each process took to start, run this command:

    systemd-analyze blame

# Manage Services

To view a list of enabled and disabled services, you use the same systemctl
command as above, but tell it to only list services:

    systemctl list-unit-files –type=service
