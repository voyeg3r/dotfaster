# command line player - Last Change: 2018 mai 30 07:04

Combinining mpg123 with zsh we can play randomically all songs of a playlist
by typing:

``` sh
    mpg123 -z **/*.mp3
```

``` markdown
    -Z, --random
            Continuous random play.  Keeps picking a random file from the command
            line or the play list.  Unlike shuffle play above, random play  never
            ends, and plays individual songs more than once.
```
