# English Club - Last Change: 2018 mai 31 08:22

# Introdução

Um clube de inglês, no qual alunos mais adiantados no estudo
da lingua inglesa organizam reuniões semanais para praticar
seu inglês, visando aquisição da fluência e domínio da
lingua.  A escola Joaquim Nogueira seria um abrigo para este
clube, mas o mesmo pode se estender virtualmente para que o
dia-a-dia dos estudantes, não dependendo exclusivamente de
professores ou local, uma vez que na nternet existem
inúmeros recursos como skype, twitter, e-mais etc. que
facilitam a interação dos membros do clube.

# Overlearning

Trabalhar os materiais de modo repetido, revisitar materiais,
pois a repetição, especialmente a repetição espaçada, gera um
nível de retenção incrível no cérebro.

# Total Physical Response

Neste método o professor ou tutor da turma representa ações
como: (caminhar, cantar, pular, pegar um copo, sentar em uma
cadeira, digitar etc.) Os alunos repetem as ações. Este
método ativa vários canais de percepção, quanto mais canais
de percepção no momento da aquisição de um conheicimento
mais rápido o aprendizado. Isto também ajuda a romper a
barreira da timidêz.

# Callan Method.

Este método é um pouco parecido com o Total Physical
Response, com a diferença que ao invés de representar as
ações as pessoas acompanham figuras das ações e objetos, e
interagem com as afirmações do professor.

# Mini-stories

http://www.englishclub.com/reading/short-stories.htm

Neste método é contada uma pequena estória e os membros se
fazem perguntas sobre a mesma, em seguida a mesma estória é
recontada em outro tempo, com alterações. Visa melhorar a
desenvoltura e naturalidade dos membros.

# spaced repetition

 * http://www.memrise.com

# Pimsleur approach

spaced repetition -  First you will be told a foreign
language phrase and then asked to repeat it.  Next, you will
be asked to remember it and say the words out loud at time
intervals that start very small and then increase.

For example, first you hear a word and then you will be asked to say it 15
[[seconds]] later, then you will be asked to say it 45 seconds later, then 1.5
minutes after that, and so on. The time intervals quickly grow until they are
measured in days  and then weeks.

This is an amazingly efficient way to form new memories.

Spaced repetition was invented back in 1932 by Professor C. A. Mace, so it’s
a very old concept. Pimsleur language courses were developed after cassette
tape technology became widespread in the 1970s.

# Técnicas para Aprender Inglês e Ampliar Vocabulário pt.1

Publicado em 08/05/2010

Esse texto aborda algumas técnicas para aprender inglês muito simples, que
talvez você jamais tenha ouvido falar, mas que podem fazer uma grande diferença
na eficiência do seu aprendizado.

“The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.”
“O principal propósito da educação não é o conhecimento, mas a ação.”
Herbert Spencer

O objetivo desse artigo é propor um método de estudo que você possa começar a
colocar em prática imediatamente. Afinal, quem você acha que aprende mais
rápido: Aquele que conhece todas as dicas e atalhos para aprender – mas nunca
as coloca em prática; Ou aquele que separa 1 hora por dia para estudar e vai
aperfeiçoando o seu método de estudo ao longo do tempo?  Portanto, AÇÃO é a
palavra-chave.

Como Tirar o Máximo desse Artigo Se você quer obter um
aproveitamento real e duradouro desse artigo, não pense que
uma única lida vai ser suficiente. Salve essa página nos
seus favoritos e volte nela de vez em quando.  Enquanto você
lê, pare e pense em formas pelas quais você pode colocar em
prática as dicas aqui compartilhadas. Debata essas dicas com
os seus colegas de estudo e veja que idéias eles tem para
colocar essas técnicas em ação.

Estude frases ou expressões, NUNCA palavras isoladas: Esse é
o meio mais eficiente para aumentar o seu vocabulário. Você
deve sempre se concentrar no contexto e não apenas na
palavra. Não basta conhecer um grande número de palavras, se
você não souber como usá-las vai acabar recorrendo à
traduções toda vez que tiver que se expressar no novo
idioma. Infelizmente, esse é um dos erros mais comuns dos
estudantes de idiomas, que normalmente focam todos os
esforços em aprender apenas as palavras, pois acreditam que
essa é a maneira mais rápida. Para conseguirmos gravar algo
em nossa memória, nós estamos sempre, consciente ou
inconscientemente, associando aquela nova informação a algo
que já sabemos. O problema com palavras soltas é que elas
são um tipo de informação muito abstrata, de difícil
retenção. Entretanto, quando temos essa palavra inserida num
contexto recebemos mais algumas peças do quebra-cabeça, que
permitem que fique mais fácil para nós associarmos esse novo
conhecimento. Agindo dessa forma, os resultados são muito
superiores e a retenção é maior e mais duradoura. Outro
ponto importante é que aprendemos a forma de uso, ou seja, a
maneira como as palavras se encaixam para dar sentido à
frase. Essa estratégia é ainda mais eficiente se essas
frases que você estuda vêm de materiais que você está lendo
ou ouvindo.  TPR – Total Physical Response TPR é uma sigla
para Total Physical Response. Esse é um método de
aprendizado de idiomas desenvolvido pelo Dr. James Asher.
Demonstração dessa Técnica para Aprender Ingles A idéia
principal dessa abordagem consiste em utilizar gestos e
movimentos corporais para ajudar no aprendizado e na
retenção do significado das palavras novas.  Você escolhe um
gesto que tenha alguma relação com o significado da palavra
e toda vez que você escuta ou usa a palavra durante as suas
sessões de estudo você faz o gesto.

# Comprehensible Input

Técnica para Aprender Inglês Comprovada por Pesquisas

Você aprende muito mais rápido se concentrando em materiais que sejam de fácil
entendimento. Esse é um dos pilares do método desenvolvido pelo especialista em
aprendizagem de idiomas, Dr. Stephen Krashen. Muitos acreditam que se aprende
mais estudando um material difícil de entender. De acordo com as pesquisas do
Dr. Krashen, esse jeito não só é mesmo eficiente, como também diminui a
motivação do estudante.  Pense bem, qualquer sessão de estudo rende muito mais
quando já dominamos parte do conteúdo e já temos capacidade de pensar sozinhos
e tirar nossas próprias conclusões. Um material que você nunca viu na vida ou
então, que está repleto de coisas novas passa a impressão que vai demorar uma
eternidade para ser assimilado. Se você lê um texto no qual você só consegue
entender 50% do que está escrito, você perdeu metade do seu tempo. Por outro
lado, um texto com cerca de 5% de palavras novas é tão fácil que é possível
focar totalmente no conteúdo e até mesmo se esquecer que o material está em
outro idioma. Isso permite uma repetição natural de várias palavras conhecidas.
Você vai ter a oportunidade de revê-las em contextos variados garantindo-lhes
uma vaga cativa na sua memória a longo prazo. Se você é um iniciante, essa é a
fórmula mais simples para construir o seu vocabulário inicial e aprender as
palavras mais freqüentes no idioma.  Num contexto tão familiar, é possível
determinar o significado da maioria das palavras novas através do contexto, sem
ter que interromper seu estudo para usar o dicionário. Ou pior, ficar sem
entender.  E esse é um ponto muito importante. Já vi discussões entre
estudantes de idiomas sobre qual tipo de dicionário usar: monolíngue, bilíngüe,
os dois… O bom mesmo é NÃO PRECISAR DE DICIONÁRIO. Pode parecer útil no
momento, mas é muito fácil se esquecer do significado da palavra tão logo você
fecha o dicionário. Além disso, existem expressões difíceis de se traduzir,
mesmo utilizando um dicionário online. É útil também para se distinguir entre
os vários significados que uma palavra pode ter. Em pouco tempo você vai ver o
seu vocabulário aumentar absurdamente.

“Education is the ability to meet life’s situations.”
“Educação é a habilidade de enfrentar as situações da vida.”
Dr. John G. Hibben Esse método de estudo vai te preparar
para enfrentar as situações reais. Isso porque, quando você
estiver conversando em inglês, você nem sempre vai conseguir
entender 100% do que está sendo dito. Utilizando materiais
fáceis de entender e deduzindo as partes desconhecidas, você
vai se acostumar a lidar com a incerteza. Diferente dos
alunos de curso que se surpreendem e ficam chateados e
desnorteados cada vez que escutam uma palavra sendo
pronunciada de um jeito diferente ou quando vêem um nativo
usando uma regra de gramática incorretamente.

# Ler em voz alta ativa o lóbulo frontal do cérebro

Narrow Reading/ Listening

Você pode usar essa técnica para
aprender inglês para construir o seu vocabulário sobre os
temas que te motivaram a começar a estudar esse idioma. Cada
assunto tem o seu vocabulário próprio. Cada pessoa tem o seu
vocabulário favorito, o seu jeito próprio de falar e
escrever.  Concentrando-se por um período razoável em um
determinado tópico ou autor, em pouco tempo você vai dominar
o respectivo vocabulário específico.  O mais importante aqui
é que você escolha conteúdos do seu interesse, de
preferência fáceis de entender, como já foi mencionado.
Portanto, resumindo… Escolha um assunto ou autor que você
goste. Encontre vários artigos, livros, podcasts, enfim,
materiais em geral relacionados com esse tema. Dê prioridade
aos que forem mais fáceis de entender. E divirta-se!

# A Técnica para Aprender Inglês que Muitos Subestimam

Parte do segredo para se adquirir um vocabulário amplo, em
qualquer idioma, é a repetição. Eu não conheço nenhum
substituto para a REPETIÇÃO. É bastante útil, especialmente
quando você tem dificuldade em encontrar um material do seu
nível e tem que lidar com algo de um nível mais avançado.
Após um curto número de repetições, lendo enquanto escuta,
você vai ser capaz de entender bem o que está sendo dito.
Podendo começar a acompanhar sem o texto e até mesmo repetir
algumas partes de cor. Depois que você alcança um nível
legal de fluência é mais interessante você procurar por
diversidade e evitar ficar muito tempo no mesmo material.
Porém enquanto você é iniciante ou intermediário a repetição
é vital, pois você ainda está construindo a sua base naquele
idioma. Para aprender mais dicas simples e eficientes:

# Conclusão

Por experiência própria e por relatos de outros estudantes
que utilizaram esses mesmos métodos eu te garanto que
aprender desse jeito é muito mais eficiente. A sensação de
esforço é bem menor, permitindo que você estude por períodos
mais longos de tempo. O mais importante, você não vai se
esquecer do que você aprendeu. Bastam algumas poucas
revisões para você voltar ao seu nível anterior. Nos cursos
tradicionais, se você para por um ano, quando volta você tem
que fazer uma prova de proficiência e, na maioria das vezes,
você tem que repetir o último nível que você cursou.  O
curioso é que depois que você termina o curso, eles garantem
que você nunca mais esquece… interessante, não acha???

# Seven rules to learn english fastest

Hi, I’m A.J. Hoge, the director of "Effortless English" and
welcome to the Free 7 Rules e-mail course. Today is rule 1.
Now, rule 1 is: Learn English phrases, not individual words.
This one, just like all the other rules, is very simple,
very easy. And, like the other rules, this rule is very,
very powerful. So simple, so powerful. What is the rule? The
rule is: always learn phrases, not individual words. So
simple.

So a phrase is a group of words, it's not... you can have a
whole sentence, but it's just a, it's even a part of a
sentence. So for example, let's say, you have the word
"hate", H.A.T.E., "hate", and you want to learn this new
word. You can, you know, just write down the word "hate",
and then you will find in your dictionary the meaning and
then you'll memorize it. Hate, hate, hate, hate. That's the
old way, that's the kind of text-book way, the school way.
Right? In school you probably remembered a lot of individual
words. You had those big vocabulary lists, you tried to
memorize all of them, trying to remember all these
individual single words. It's not a good way to learn.

Much better if you learn a phrase, a group of words. And
where do you find these phrases? You find these phrases in
the real English podcasts that you're listening to, in the
real English story books that you're reading. So you don't
memorize a list in a book. No, no, no. You listen to real
English and when you hear a new word you write it down. Or
when you're reading a story book and you see a new word, you
write it down. But do not just write down that word, you
wanna write down the whole phrase or sentence that it's in.
All of it.

So instead of saying "hate", and you just write down "hate",
you would say... you would write down "John hates
ice-cream". You write down the whole phrase. Why do we do
this? What's the power of phrases? Well, phrases give you a
lot of information, much more information.

# Number 1

Phrases are easier to remember, because they have meaning,
they have a kind of a picture, a story, especially when you
get them from something that you're reading or listening to.
You'll remember it. "John hates ice-cream". You remember the
whole story, you remember who John is, you remember that he
had ice-cream and then you remember he hated it, he didn't
like it. Right? So you have all these extra pieces of
information, all this extra information helps you remember
the meaning of the phrase and the meaning of that word. So
it helps your memory. Much easier to remember.

# Number 2

There's a bonus. When you learn phrases, you are learning
grammar also. You are not only learning an individual word,
you're learning grammar, you're learning how to use that
word correctly. You don't need to think about the grammar.
You don't need to know the rules. It's automatic. This is
another way that native speakers learn English grammar,
because when we're children, we learn with phrases. We learn
groups of words, not just one word by one word by one word.
Word by word is slow and it doesn't help, and you don't
learn any grammar. But when you learn a whole phrase, you
write down a phrase, you're getting extra information. Maybe
you don't know it, but you are.

For example "John hates ice-cream". Just that word, that -s
on the end: "hates", right?, John hates. Well, you know from
grammar study that, you know, you're... you're making the
subject and the verb agree. You don't need to think about
that. Just write down the phrase "John hates ice-cream" and
study it, and review it. Always learn the phrase, not just
that word. And so, in the future, whenever you say "he hates
ice-cream", "she hates ice-cream", you will add that S, the
"sss", right? because that's how you learned it. You learned
it correctly. You learned it from a phrase.

On the other hand, if you learn it from a text book, you
just learn: the word "hate" means "does not like". And you
only learn that form, "hate", "hate", "hate", and you study,
you study, you study, you memorize it. That's when you start
making mistakes, because you learned it only this one way.
You didn't learn it with other words, so sometimes you'll
say "he hate ice-cream". You'll forget the S because you,
you never learned it correctly in a sentence, in a phrase.

So, (is) this is a very simple rule, our last rule in the
course*, very, very important: every time you find a new
word, always, always, always write the phrase or the
sentence. When you review that word again, when you study it
again, always, always, always study the entire phrase or
sentence. Never study just the word, always the whole
phrase. Do this every time. Your grammar will begin to
improve. It'll improve much faster. And you'll remember the
vocabulary faster and more easily. And you will use that
vocabulary more quickly. So you get a lot of great benefits.
A lot of great stuff happens when you learn phrases instead
of words. So phrases, phrases, phrases. Learn them.

I hope you enjoyed the rule number one. Use this rule. Now,
your homework is to get a little phrase notebook. So when
you find new English vocabulary in a lesson, in something
you're listening to, in a book, in an article, write down
the phrase, not just one word. Write down the entire whole
phrase that you find, and then review that phrase again and
again each day. And you will create a notebook full of
phrases, full of sentences, not individual words. Never an
individual word.

Ok, so that's rule 1, tomorrow you'll get another e-mail
with rule number 2. So I will see you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

# Rule 2

Hi! This is A.J. Hoge again, the director of "Effortless
English" and today we're gonna learn about Rule Number 2.
Now, rule number two is a surprise for many people. Rule
number two is simple: do not study grammar rules. Do not do
it!. Now, I know this is a tough rule for some people,
because most of your life learning English you have been
told to learn grammar rules. In Middle School, in High
School, in University, in language schools, everywhere in
the world: grammar, grammar, grammar, grammar, grammar.

So my first question to you is: did it work? Was it
successful? If you're watching this video you have studied
English before, in school, somewhere, and probably you
focused a lot on grammar rules. So my question is: Can you
speak English easily, quickly and automatically right now?
If the answer's no, why not? Because you have studied
English for many years already.

Why can't you speak quickly, easily and automatically? Why
not? Well, it's not your fault, actually. The reason, the
answer for most people is that you studied grammar rules too
much, you focused on grammar rules. Why? Because your
teachers told you to.

Why is it bad to study grammar rules? Well, because when you
study grammar rules, when you focus on grammar rules, you
focus on analysing English. In other words, you think about
English, you think about the past tense, the present tense,
the future, the present perfect, the past perfect. Now, for
writing English, errr... that's OK. Why? Because when you
write English you have time. You can go slowly, you can
write very slowly, you can think about it, you can erase
your mistake... it's ok. You don't need to write fast.

But for speaking there's no time. You do not have time to
think about the rules for the present perfect tense in
English when you're listening and speaking. There's no time.
Someone asked you a question, and you must answer
immediately. You have no time to think about prepositions,
you have no time to think about verb tenses, possessives,
all the stuff you learned. There's no time.

How do native speakers learn grammar? Well, I'm an English
native speaker and I can tell you I never studied grammar
rules. Not until high school, and we studied grammar rules
for writing. In college native speakers study grammar rules
again. Why? For writing. But for speaking, we don't. So
how do we learn grammar rules? Well, we learn through
listening, through hearing correct grammar, again and
again and again and again. A lot of correct grammar. So
the best way to learn English grammar is through input.
In other words, English coming in, mostly through your
ears but reading is also ok, but don't read text books,
don't read grammar books, just read easy English books,
easy novels. But most of all you'll be listening.

Now, in the next e-mails that you get, I'll tell you exactly
how to learn grammar in an easy way, in an effortless way,
without studying rules. So keep getting those e-mails, read
the next e-mails because in later e-mails I'll tell you
exactly how to learn English grammar so you can use it
quickly and very fast when you're speaking, not just
writing. But for now, for today, the, the number two rule I
want you to remember is: do not study grammar rules. If you
focus on grammar rules it will hurt your speaking. You'll
speak more slowly, you'll understand more slowly.

So if you have grammar books throw 'em away, put 'em in the
trash, good-bye grammar books. If you want you can burn
them, you know... put 'em on fire, because they're useless,
they will not help you with your English speaking or your
English learning and listening. So good-bye grammar books,
no more grammar rules. Yeeeh! That should make you happy.

Ok, good enough. This is the second rule for learning to
speak excellent English. Tomorrow you'll get the next rule,
rule number three tomorrow. So I hope you enjoyed this
e-mail course and these videos and I'll see you next time.
Bye-bye.

# Rule 3

Hi, I'm A.J. Hoge, the director of "Effortless English",
welcome to Rule Number 3. So rule number three is very
simple, so easy, and yet very, very powerful. In fact, I
usually say this is the number one suggestion, the number
one rule, the most important rule, and so easy, and it is
this: learn with your ears, not with your eyes. Ok? If you
want to speak excellent English, you gotta learn with your
ears. Listening, listening, listening and more listening is
the key to speaking excellent English, it's the most
important thing, because if you listen a lot, you're gonna
learn vocabulary, you will learn grammar, you will get
faster and you will understand better.

Listening is kind of the magic key to great English
speaking. There's a lot of research about this and it all
shows the same thing: listening is the most important thing
you can do. So this tells us one reason you probably have
some trouble with your speaking. Why? Because again, when
you learned English in school you probably learned mostly
with your eyes. Most English schools, middle school, high
school, university, private English schools, most of them
focus on text books in the classroom. I'm sure this has been
true for you also. So text books, text books, text books.

So that's the problem. In school, basically, you learn with
your eyes, and basically, in school you learn to write
English. You also learn to think about English. So you know
a lot about grammar rules. In fact, you know more about
grammar rules than most Americans, most Canadians, most
British people, 'cause native speakers don't study that
stuff very much. Native speakers learn to speak English with
their ears, by listening, listening, listening. And that's
what you must do if you want to speak English quickly,
easily, automatically, correctly, just like a native
speaker.

So, let me be a little more specific about listening,
because it's important how you listen and what you listen
to. The most important thing is you must listen to easy
English. It must be easy. What do I mean by easy? Well, you
should understand 95% [per cent] or more without stopping,
without a dictionary. So that's quite easy, right? You want
a lot of easy English listening. Now, you might try
children's programmes. You might try children's audio books.
Or maybe audio books for, you know, teenagers, like
Americans who are 13, 14, 15 years old. If that's too
difficult, find something easier. You can listen to
programmes for very small children.

# audio books links

Now, if something's more difficult you can still use it, but
you usually need the text, you need to be able to read it.
So that's also useful, you can get, errr... an audio article
or a speech, or a lesson's even, and you have the text, so
you can read and listen at the same time. That's ok also.
But listening is the most important thing. Listen, listen,
listen. Every chance you have. Get an i-pod, you know, get
an MP3 player or an i-pod. Listen to English all the time.
Listen in the morning when you get up, listen when you go to
work, or when you're at home, listen when you're at lunch,
listen when you're coming home from work, listen in the
evening. Lots and lots and lots of English listening. Lots
of easy listening.

That's your number 1 key: listen to podcasts, listen to my
videos. I have a free podcast, listen to that. Listen,
listen, listen. OK? So it's simple, it's easy and it's
super-powerful. Please, do this, focus on listening, not on
text books, not on learning with your eyes. Learn with your
ears, it's the most powerful rule. Ok? so that's rule number
3. Tomorrow you'll get the next e-mail: rule number 4. I'll
see you then. Bye-bye.

# Rule 4

Hi, this is A.J. again, director of "Effortless English".
Welcome to the fourth rule for speaking excellent English.
Now, this rule is also very simple. In fact, all of these
rules are simple, but when you use them, when you use all of
them, change the way you use English, you will get fantastic
results. So rule number 4 is also very important. Rule
number 4, again, is very simple, and it is this: Learn
deeply. Deep learning.

What does that mean? Well, deep learning basically means
repeating what you learn again and again and again, many,
many times. So this, again, is very different from the way
you learned in school. Unfortunately, most schools have a
lot of pressure to go fast, fast, fast, fast. They're always
pushing the students to learn more vocabulary, more
vocabulary, very fast. New grammar, new grammar, new
grammar. Every week new grammar. Every week a lot of new
words, right? 'cause they're going through these text books
and they're trying to finish the text book very quickly.

So, what's the problem? Well, the problem is, the students,
you, you learn a lot of stuff, but then you forget it, you
forget what you learnt. Or you remember the basic idea but
you can't use it. So, for example, all students who have
studied English learned the past tense, you learned the past
tense, but you studied it in a text book and then, boom,
very fast, you went and you learned more grammar. You
learned possessives, you learned the future, you learned the
present perfect.

So you're constantly going very fast, so you never mastered
the past tense. You did not learn the past tense deeply,
deeply, deeply like a native speaker. That's why you make
mistakes with the past tense, still. You studied many years
but you still make mistakes with the past tense. It's
because you never mastered it, you never learned it very,
very deeply.

So you need to slow down and repeat everything you learn
again and again and again. For example, when people use my
lessons, when they buy my lessons I tell them: you listen to
the same lesson set, the same group of lessons, the same
topic, every day for two weeks. That's right. It's the same
lessons, maybe two or three lessons, you listen to the same
ones on Monday, Tuesday, same lessons, Wednesday, same
lessons, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, for one week, two
weeks. If it's still difficult, then you do it again, three
weeks, four weeks. It's not a race. You want to learn
everything very deeply so that you really learn it, so that
you never forget it, so you can really use it. That's deep
learning.

So if you have an audio article or a podcast, something
you're listening to and you like it, don't just listen one
time, one time is not enough. Five times is not enough. You
should listen to that (the article, the speech, whatever it
is), you should listen to it 30 times, 50 times, 100 times
or more.

Now, you can have a few things or maybe you have two or
three audio articles and each day you listen to them all,
but then you repeat them again, and then you repeat them
again, and you repeat them again. You're learning deeply,
deeply, deeply. Even after you know the vocabulary, continue
listening to the same thing. Because knowing the vocabulary
just means you can take a test and you say the meaning, but
when you hear it, do you instantly understand it? Can you
use it quickly and easily, automatically? If the answer's
no, you need to repeat more, you need to listen to that same
word, phrase, sentence, article, lesson, again and again and
again. Many, many times. This is one of the key secrets to
speaking faster and to really learning grammar correctly and
using it correctly.

So, focus... for example you listen to a story in the past
tense. Listen to that story again and again and again and
again, one week, two weeks, three weeks. Then another story
in the past tense, one week, two weeks, three weeks. And
then another story in the past tense, one week, two weeks,
three weeks. You never stop! I'm a native speaker and all my
life I've been learning the past tense. I still listen to
the past tense now, and I will as long as I live.

So you never stop this basic, key, verb tenses, grammar,
learning all of it, the... the.. the c-... the most common
words, you gotta keep listening to them like a native
speaker, you hear them every single day. You repeat them
again and again. I've heard the past tense... I don't know,
tens of thousands of times, millions of times. I've heard
the basic most common vocabulary in English every day
thousands, tens of thousands, millions of times, and I will
continue to hear them. That's why I can use them quickly and
automatically, and maybe you can't.

You just need more repetition, you gotta learn more deeply.
Focus on the most common verbs, the most common vocabulary,
the most common English, through listening and then, repeat,
repeat, repeat. When you do that, that's the key, that's the
secret, that's how you will develop, that's how you will get
automatic speaking.

OK? So that's our rule today for rule number 4: deep, deep
learning, repeat everything a lot, repeat it many times. So
I'll see you tomorrow for rule number 5. Have a great day.
Take care. Bye-bye.

# Rule 5

Hi, this is A.J. Hoge, the director of "Effortless English".
Welcome to day 5 of the seven rules to excellent speaking
e-mail course. Now, remember? Before in one of the other
rules I told you: do not study English grammar. And maybe
you're thinking, "oh, my God, but how do I learn grammar and
how can I use correct grammar?". Well, today I'm going to
tell you how to learn English grammar without studying
grammar rules. Mmm, that's a little tricky. How do we do
that?

Well, there's actually a very simple, easy, powerful
technique. And research shows that this technique is the
best way to learn grammar. English grammar. Grammar for any
language, actually. So, what is this technique. Well, it's
called point of view stories. Point of view stories. Or
point of view mini-stories. "Mini" means "small". So these
are small stories. Now, what's the secret to these stories?
How do they teach you grammar?

Well, what we do is, we tell the same story but we change
the point of view. In other words, we change the time, for
example. Or we change the grammar somehow in the story. Let
me show you an example, a very simple example. When I teach
point of view stories, I teach a funny or short little
story. And maybe the first time, I teach it in the present,
it's happening now. So, for example:

There is a boy, his name is Bill. Bill goes to the store. He
buys a bottle of water. He pays two dollars for the water.

Ok, that's it. That's the... that's our little story right
now. So that was in the present, and all you need to do is
just listen to it. Listen, listen, listen, listen again.
Deep learning, remember? you gonna repeat it a lot of times.
Now, how do we learn grammar with a story? Well, next, I
tell the same story, but now it's the past:

There was a boy named Bill. Yesterday, he went to the store.
He bought a bottle of water. He paid two dollars for the
water.

That's all. Now, in a normal story, in a normal
point-of-view story, it's longer and it's more difficult, of
course. In my lessons, my point-of-view stories are longer,
they're more difficult. But this is an example. It's an easy
example. So now, you've got the present, you've got the
past, you listen to that story in the past many times.

Don't think about the grammar rules, you do not think "oh,
this is the past tense, oh, paid is an irregular verb". No,
no, no, don't think about that. Just listen to the story and
understand the meaning. That's all you need to do. Listen to
the first story, understand the meaning. Listen to the
second story, understand the meaning. That's all. It's easy,
effortless grammar learning. So next, I might tell the same
story in the future. So I'd say, imagine, imagine in the
future, next year. Imagine:

There will be a boy. His name will be Bill. He's going to go
to the store and he'll buy a bottle of water. He's going to
pay two dollars for the water.

So that's the end of our short example in the future. So,
what do you do? You just listen to this little easy story in
the future. You listen in the present. You listen to the
past. You listen to the future. And then I can do it again,
I can practise any kind of grammar with this. For example, I
might say, ah...

There was a boy. Since last year, he has gone to the store
every day. He has bought a bottle of water every day. And
every day, since last year, he has paid two dollars for the
water.

So, you don't need to know the name of the grammar or the
verb tense that I'm using. It's called the present perfect
but you don't need to know that. I don't want you to think
about that. All you need to do is listen to the story. I'm
using words to help you understand the meaning. I said
"since last year". So now you understand that these changes,
these verbs, they change because something happened in the
past and has continued for a while.

But you don't need to think about that. That's why these
stories are so easy and powerful. You just listen. You
listen to story number one. You listen to the story number
two, the story number three, the story number four, and you
learn the grammar like a native speaker, like a child. When
you learn grammar like this, using these kinds of stories,
it goes deep. You learn to use grammar automatically,
quickly. You learn to understand it instantly, quickly,
automatically. You don't need to think about a bunch of
rules.

Forget the rules, you don't need to know them. You want to
learn it automatically, the same way I learnt English
grammar, the same way all native speakers learned English
grammar. Learn English grammar using these point-of-view
stories. Your grammar, your speaking grammar will really
improve quickly, and you'll feel more relaxed because you'll
start to use correct grammar automatically, you won't even
think about it. You can stop thinking so much. You can just
relax, listen and speak.

Ok? So these are powerful point of view stories to learn English grammar.

Alright? That's the end of today's rule, I will see you
tomorrow for our next rule. Take care and have a great day.
Bye-bye.

# Rule 6

Hi, this is A.J. Hoge, director of "Effortless English", and
today we have rule number 6 to speak excellent English.
What's rule number 6? Rule number 6 is to use real English
materials. Only use real English materials. Now, before I
told you: stop using text books. In fact I told you to throw
away your text books. I told you to burn your text books. I
hope you did it.

Alright. So now you have no text books. They're all burned
up or in the trash. So what should you do? How can you learn
now? Well, I want you to use real materials. What do I mean
with real materials? Well, I mean English materials that are
for native speakers or that are very similar to native
speaker materials. For example, when you read, don't
read text books. Text books are terrible things to read,
you don't want to use those. If you want to read
English, and reading is great, you should read easy
English story books. Easy English novels. And in... in
later e-mails, in some of my bonus e-mails, I'll tell
you exactly how to do that and give you some suggestions
for good books to read. But you wanna read easy English
books that you enjoy. Imagine that! right? Pick
something you enjoy, something that's interesting,
maybe a romance book, maybe an adventure story.
Something like that. It's easy, it's fun. That's the
best kind of reading.

So, you know that you should focus on your listening. Your
listening should be 80% of your learning. So what should you
listen to? Same thing, you should listen to easy English
that you enjoy, about topics that you enjoy. You should
enjoy the speaker, you should enjoy their voice, you should
enjoy their energy, you should enjoy the topics. So you
don't want to listen to text book CDs, those are terrible,
you know: - hello, how are you? - I'm fine, and you? Oh,
terrible, terrible, terrible. You don't want to listen to
actors, ok? do not listen to actors. Listen to people who
are speaking more naturally. Just like these videos are good
to listen to, actually. You can just practise by listening
to me talk.

I also have a podcast. Podcasts are great. Now you can get
on the Internet, you can find a lot of real English
listening material. Podcasts are perfect. I have a podcast.
You can go to effortlessenglish.lybsin.com and you can
listen to me talking about English, talking about learning,
talking about my ideas, and it's free, it's easy. You can
just listen, listen, listen, a lot of real materials. I'm
just talking, and I'm a real native speaker. I'm not acting.
And there's a lot of other podcasts out there. You can pick,
you know, English learning podcasts, but you can also pick a
podcast about any topic you like. If you like sports, find
English podcasts that talk about sports. If you like cars,
find ones that talk about cars. If you like exercise or
health, find podcasts about that.

You can also find audio books. Audio books are another great
way to practise your listening. An audio book is just a book
that someone's reading and they're recorded, so instead of
reading the book, you listen to the book. Again, choose
audio books that are easy. You may need to start with
children's story books. That's ok, you know. Enjoy them,
it's more fun than a text book. I guarantee even listening
to a story book is more interesting and more fun than some
boring text book. As you get better, when your level is
higher, you can listen to audio books for young adults or
for older children. And you just keep listening, listening,
and when it's too easy then you choose something a
little more difficult and you listen, listen, listen
more, a little more difficult, a little more difficult.
Eventually, when you are advanced, you can listen to CNN
or the BBC or American movies, British movies,
Australian movies, etc. But that's at an advanced level.
In the beginning start with easy stuff.

So you're always choosing these real things: audio books,
podcasts, movies, TV shows (they can be children's TV shows,
that's ok). Not text books and not text books CDs. This is
so important, because when you listen to real English
materials, you get real spoken English. Text books don't
teach you real English, they teach you formal English. They
teach you written English, in fact. The vocabulary in text
books, the grammar, the style, it's all for writing. Even
though you're listening to these conversations they're not
normal conversations. But when you listen to real materials
(audio books, conversations podcasts, anything that is real)
that's the real English we use, Americans, Canadians,
British, Australian, that's how we really speak. Those are
the words we use in normal conversations. That's the
pronunciation we use.

So, real English materials only, not text book CDs, OK? It's
again a very simple, easy rule. And now we have the
Internet, it's so easy to find these real materials. Just do
a Google search. And if you keep getting my e-mails, you'll
actually get more suggestions from me. I'll tell you how to
find podcasts, how to find easy listening.

OK. So that's rule number 6. I hope you enjoyed it. Tomorrow
rule nuber 7, our last rule. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
Have a great day. Bye-bye.

# Rule 7

Hi, this is A.J. Hoge, the director of "Effortless English"
and today is the last rule, rule number 7. And rule number 7
is very, very powerful. Rule number 7 helps you to speak
quickly and to understand instantly, automatically,
immediately. This is true fluency, true automatic speaking.
So, what is rule number 7? Rule number 7, the last rule is
to use listen-and-answer mini stories.

What are these mini stories, listen-and-answer, and why are
they powerful? Well, first, remember in the past when you
went to English school. In school you probably learnt with a
lot of listen-and-repeat. For example, the teacher said:
"repeat after me, class: hi, how are you?" and the class
together, everybody said: "hi, how are you?". Then, the
teacher said, "I'm fine, and you?". Then, all of the class
together said, "I'm fine, and you?". This is
listen-and-repeat. It's an old way to learn English. But
it's not powerful. When you listen and repeat, you don't
need to think in English, you don't need to think. You just
repeat what the teacher said. Maybe you don't understand,
but still, you repeat. That's an old way, don't do it.

Much more powerful is: listen and answer, especially
listen-and-answer mini stories. These are special kind of
stories where the teacher "asks" a story. Now, I do not say
"tells" a story, I say "asks" a story. The teacher asks a
lot of very simple and easy questions. Why? Well, because
the student must answer questions constantly, constantly
answering. Hearing a question, answering. Hearing a
question, answering. This is like real conversation. When
you use these listen-and-answer stories, you teach yourself
to understand quickly and to respond quickly, to speak very
quickly and automatically. No thinking. That's why these are
powerful. You learn to think in English and you learn to
speak quickly, without thinking, without translating.

Now, I will give you a very, very easy and simple example of
a question-and-answer mini story. Just a couple of
sentences. Now, imagine there's a short, little story. In
the old method the teacher would say: "repeat after me", and
the teacher says: "There was a boy, he went to the store, he
bought a candy bar". And then the students repeat the story:
"There was a boy, he went to the store, he bought a candy
bar".

No. In listen-and-answer stories the teacher asks the
questions, the teacher asks a lot of questions, very easy
questions. We use easy questions because we don't want you
to think. If I asked a difficult question, then you might
stop and think, but if the question is very easy, you can
shout an answer. One word, two words, ok. For example, I
would say: "Class, there was a boy. Was there a boy?" And
you shout "yes, yes". And I say "was there a boy or was
there a girl?" And you immediately, instantly shout "a boy,
a boy". And I say "Ah, so, there was a boy?" Again you shout
"yes, yes, there was a boy". And I say, "Ah, I see, there
was a boy. What was his name?" You don't know, so you guess
"John", or "Jim", anything. You shout an answer. And I say
"Ah, yes, his name was John". Was John a boy or was John a
girl? And you shout "a boy, a boy". And then I continue,
more questions, more questions. And because you are
constantly answering questions, you learn to think in
English, you learn to respond, to answer very, very quickly
in English.

These are very, very powerful. Now, of course, this example
is very, very simple, supersimple. In my real mini story
lessons it's... it's more difficult and much more
interesting, and there are a lot more questions. And when
you use these mini story lessons, you will learn to speak so
much faster, so much more easily and automatically. This is
very powerful. So, your rule number 7, absolutely very
important: use listen-and-answer mini stories. Super, super
important. Always do this.

And, of course, you can find a native speaker to make these
stories for you. Show them this video and then they will
understand how to do it. Or you can get my lessons. And, in
fact, that is your next step, because now you're finished.
You finished the 7 rules of effortless English.
Congratulations. Now you need to use them, and you must use
all of them so that you will learn much more quickly, so
that you will understand English very quickly and so that
you will speak English easily, quickly and automatically.

An interesting text to read in lingq
http://www.lingq.com/learn/en/workdesk/item/6488552/reader/?select=6609976

There are certain words that serve a function of intensifying that have very limited collocations.
In fact, some of them only occur with one possible word. It’s what’s called a very strong collocation, or a “word partnership”.
Study the list of these partnerships below.
* Look at them. They’re madly in love.
* They’re twins, but they’re radically different.
* It’s safer where medicine and doctors are readily available.
* Leaving her is something I deeply regret.
* The war is an event they still bitterly resent.
* If you think you’re finished then you’re sadly mistaken.
* The two religious leaders are deeply divided.
* The prisoners managed to narrowly escape.
* If you help me I’ll be eternally grateful.
* I want you to know that I’m terribly sorry.
* I want to see the kitchen spotlessly clean.
* The stock market is fiercely competitive.
* Don’t tell anyone – it’s strictly confidential.
* Is that what you truly believe?
* She is someone I sorely miss.
* The UFO conspiracy is still hotly debated.
* I know it’s just marketing, but I think they genuinely care.
* All we can do is sincerely hope.
* Your guests anxiously await.
* She thought no one would notice but it was glaringly obvious.
* It’s possible, but I seriously doubt it.
* They don’t know for sure. Right now it’s pure conjecture.
* The scientist’s research was sharply criticized.
* Their technology is vastly superior.
* Starting the conflict is something they vehemently deny.
* Don’t worry about that. At your age it’s perfectly normal.
* The two concepts are diametrically opposed.

# Impotant skills to a poliglot
Noticing
Processing
Guessing

Short term memory is absolutely important in order to
developing the ability to guess the meaning of the words in
context

Depending on situation the words gain another meaning,
because this you don’t have to see words as if they have one
single meaning, but infinit meanings

you need automaticity with clusters of words! In other
meaning “collocations” many collocations are grammatically
incorrect

More than 30 years of research show us that native speakers
know 20,000 individual words but several hundreds thousands
collocations


1 - The apple is red        5 - He gives it to John        9 - I must give it to him

2 - It is John's apple        6 - She gives it to him        10 - I want to give it to her

3 - I give John the apple    7 - Is the apple red?        11 - I'm going to know tomorrow

4 - We give him the apple    8 - The apples are red        12 - I can't eat the apple


You will not get fluent in English by reading or doing written exercices,
you get fluent by listening and answering, every single day.

Do not listen and study materials based in one verbal tense, i.e. only
present tense, only future tense etc, because in real situations you
will find all tenses.

“Neural tissue required to learn and understand a new language will develop automatically from simple exposure to the language—which is how babies learn their first language,” Dr Sulzberger says.

# Dicas do app discord

my user on discord: voyager

``` txt
        CTRL/CMD + K: Teleport Anywhere You Need Ever with our new and robust Quick Switcher.
            Switch between text channels, voice channels, and DMs.
            Snap back to your last chat.
            Display unread mentions from channels.
        Filter your Quick Switches with various commands:
            @ limits search to users in your current server
            * only searches servers
            # only searches text channels
            ! only searches voice channels
        The internet can be a scary place, so we’ve added a few safety features:
            Safe Direct Messaging: images you receive in a DM from a non-friend will be automatically scanned by using fancy machine learning. Any flagged images will be deleted. You can turn off Safe Direct Messaging for your account under the User Settings > Privacy tab.
            Global DM Privacy Setting: a one-click global option so you can set whether or not you want DMs from non-friends. If you want, you can still override the global setting on a per-server basis.
            Server Auto-moderation: the new Explicit Content Filtering option will auto-detect and delete images and uploads deemed inappropriate. This is off by default. To enable this, simply check the Explicit Content Filtering option in server settings.
            More safety features are coming. Read the full scoop here
        Removed geotagging when uploading a photo to Discord from your phone because, honestly, we don’t want to know where you’ve been.
        League of Legends Beta client is supported for Friend Sync.
        Improved performance of enormous servers like Overwatch and Dreamgrove. Keep testing our limits, bruh. We got you.
        Fixed a bug that caused users in Do Not Disturb to be heavily disturbed by push notifications on their phone :sweaty-towel-guy:

    Reactions are now on iOS! Respond to your friends with low commitment pictures instead of words (long press on a message to add a reaction).
    Typing a message with up to 27 Emoji and no characters will result in the Emoji becoming what they’ve always dreamed to be: big beautiful Wumboji.
    Search on mobile is complete: Now you don’t have to be at your computer to recall that obscure bit of info your buddy linked ten months ago.
    Carry your Nitro perks from desktop with you to the mobile app - animate your avatar with GIF wizardry, use your server’s custom emotes anywhere in Discord, upload larger files, and see your Nitro-exclusive badge to prove that our love is real.
    Even faster loading: We heard you guys had too much time to read the loading lines, so we turned some knobs and made Discord load even faster. Good luck reading them now.
    Brand spankin' new chat input, with these bells and whistles:

        Built-in camera for streamlined potato selfies :potato: :selfie:
        Quick images + files picker, gotta go fast
        Send multiple attachments in one message

    To use your own personal file picker, use the launcher icon on the top left above the folder
    We found Search hiding in the tall grass! With that fancy magnifying glass, can you see why kids love <popular copyrighted brand name breakfast food>?
    You can pick your friends, you can pick your nose... and you can also pick the order your servers are in, now that server sorting is on Android.
    Improved markdown support including: jumbo emojis and better code blocks, better URLs, masked links, etc. field.
